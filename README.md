<h1>Project Overview:</h1>

In this project I used different classification algorithms to find out fatal health. I used Kaggles free GPUs and Datasets in this competion. Those different algorithms include random forrest, decision tree, xgboost and so on. Initially I used feature engineering to get my data into the best shape.
